# Owl Carousel Inclusion

* Version: 2.2.1
* Author: David Deutsch
* Website: https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/

## How to Include

From Front Street's `/dist` directory, include the JavaScript file, `plugins/owl-carousel/owl-carousel.min.js` in your website. You don't need to include any CSS files for Owl Carousel.

## JavaScript

To lighten things up, we've compiled a custom owl-carousel.js file to go with Front Street. Below is a list of all plugins that come with Owl Carousel by default. We've left out the LazyLoad, Video, and Hashtag URL Link plugins in our custom-compiled version.

* owl.carousel.js - yes
* owl.autorefresh.js - yes
* ~~owl.lazyload.js~~ - no
* owl.autoheight.js - yes
* ~~owl.video.js~~ - no
* owl.animate.js - yes
* owl.autoplay.js - yes
* owl.navigation.js - yes
* ~~owl.hash.js~~ - no
* owl.support.js - yes

## CSS

In our package we've included only the Sass files from Owl Carousel that we're using.

* core - yes
* animate - yes
* autoheight - yes
* ~~lazyload~~ - no
* ~~video~~ - no
